# n-queens
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Implemented Functions
findNQueensSolution: returns a matrix representing a single nxn chessboard, with n queens placed such that none of them can attack each other.

countNQueensSolutions: returns the number of nxn chessboards that exist, with n queens placed such that none of them can attack each other.

## Board Class
has methods for checking if conflicts exist.

### Also includes n-rooks
